Keeping the present-day scenario in mind, JEE Advanced Physics series is written for students, to allow them not only to learn the tools but also to see why they work so nicely in explaining the beauty of ideas behind the subject. The central goal of this series is to help the students develop a thorough understanding of Physics as a subject. This series stresses on building a rock-solid technical knowledge based on firm foundation of the fundamental principles followed by a large collection of formulae. The primary philosophy of this series is to guide the aspirants towards detailed roundwork for strong conceptual understanding and development of problem-solving skills like mature and experienced physicists.

            This updated Third Edition of the series will help the aspirants prepare for both Advanced and Main levels of JEE conducted for IITs and other elite engineering institutions in India. This book will also be equally useful for the students preparing for Physics Olympiads.
            
            All books in this series are enriched with detailed exhaustive theory that introduces the concepts of Physics in a clear, concise, thorough and easy-to-understand language. A large collection of relevant problems is provided in eight major categories (including updated archive for JEE Advanced and JEE Main), for which the solutions are demonstrated in a logical and stepwise manner.</p>

Ever since its first edition in 1949, Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine has been a companion and reference book for every medical student as well as practitioner. As far as the scenario of PG Medical Entrance exams is concerned, a lot of questions are often handpicked from Harrison. But often there is a time shortage to cover important topics from Harrison before the exam. As the title of the book suggests, it is my “NOTE BOOK” of USEFUL ONELINERS, MOST COMMONS, FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ), IMPORTANT TABLES and CHARTS based on Harrison’s 19th edition is by no means a substitute for text book and is solely intended for the purpose of PG Entrance exams. As somebody who has cleared the PG entrance exams recently, it included page numbers of “HIGH YIELDING TOPICS” from Harrison’s 19th edition for those students interested in further reading. Hope that this book will be an indispensable weapon for you to crack the entrance exams.</p>

        <p id="description35" class="description">In the past few years, the IIT-JEE has evolved as an examination designed to check a candidate’s true scientific skills. The examination pattern needs one to see those little details which others fail to see. These details tell us how much in-depth we should know to explain a concept in the right direction. Keeping the present-day scenario in mind, JEE Advanced Physics series is written for students, to allow them not only to learn the tools but also to see why they work so nicely in explaining the beauty of ideas behind the subject. The central goal of this series is to help the students develop a thorough understanding of Physics as a subject. This series stresses on building a rock-solid technical knowledge based on firm foundation of the fundamental principles followed by a large collection of formulae. The primary philosophy of this series is to guide the aspirants towards detailed roundwork for strong conceptual understanding and development of problem-solving skills like mature and experienced physicists.

            This updated Third Edition of the series will help the aspirants prepare for both Advanced and Main levels of JEE conducted for IITs and other elite engineering institutions in India. This book will also be equally useful for the students preparing for Physics Olympiads.
            
            All books in this series are enriched with detailed exhaustive theory that introduces the concepts of Physics in a clear, concise, thorough and easy-to-understand language. A large collection of relevant problems is provided in eight major categories (including updated archive for JEE Advanced and JEE Main), for which the solutions are demonstrated in a logical and stepwise manner.</p>

Ever since its first edition in 1949, Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine has been a companion and reference book for every medical student as well as practitioner. As far as the scenario of PG Medical Entrance exams is concerned, a lot of questions are often handpicked from Harrison. But often there is a time shortage to cover important topics from Harrison before the exam. As the title of the book suggests, it is my “NOTE BOOK” of USEFUL ONELINERS, MOST COMMONS, FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ), IMPORTANT TABLES and CHARTS based on Harrison’s 19th edition is by no means a substitute for text book and is solely intended for the purpose of PG Entrance exams. As somebody who has cleared the PG entrance exams recently, it included page numbers of “HIGH YIELDING TOPICS” from Harrison’s 19th edition for those students interested in further reading. Hope that this book will be an indispensable weapon for you to crack the entrance exams.</p>

        <p id="description59" class="description">"DAMS HARRISON NOTE BOOK-FOR PG ENTRANCE”. Ever since its first edition in 1949, Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine has been a companion and reference book for every medical student as well as practitioner. As far as the scenario of PG Medical Entrance exams is concerned, a lot of questions are often handpicked from Harrison. But often there is a time shortage to cover important topics from Harrison before the exam. As the title of the book suggests, it is my “NOTE BOOK” of USEFUL ONELINERS, MOST COMMONS, FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ), IMPORTANT TABLES and CHARTS based on Harrison’s 19th edition is by no means a substitute for text book and is solely intended for the purpose of PG Entrance exams. As somebody who has cleared the PG entrance exams recently, it included page numbers of “HIGH YIELDING TOPICS” from Harrison’s 19th edition for those students interested in further reading. Hope that this book will be an indispensable weapon for you to crack the entrance exams.</p>
